# SOLVED
* Get the sum of the same products purchased in one order (Produt = 'APPLE', Amount = 25)
* Save products with over 50 purchases into a collection and add them later to invoices. 
* Add products with PRICE + VAT > 500 in one invoice
* Add products to one invoice until it reaches the threshold below 500
* 

# ISSUES
* Last product in the fifties package does not get added to the invoice
* Leftover amount of products is ignored => 75 products, 50 is added to the fifties collection and 25 is ignored
